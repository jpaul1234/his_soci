## What is HIS SOCI?

The HIS SOCI assessment tool measures the status and goals of an HIS across five stages, identifies gaps, and supports the
development of roadmaps to improve HIS capabilities related to processes, people, and systems essential for achieving a countryâ€™s
health goals. This toolkit responds to these research questions:

 - 1. What are the stages of HIS development?
 - 2. How can HIS be assessed and their maturity continuously improved to achieve better health outcomes?


The assessment is based on a measurement scale consisting of 39 essential HIS subcomponents across five stages from emerging to
optimized. The scale outlines key components of HIS improvement and defines attributes of each subcomponent on a five-point Likert
scale. For more information about the full toolkit and its creation, visit:
[https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit](https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit)

### How do I complete the assessment?

For each of the 39 subcomponents, you will be asked to determine the current and goal status of your national HIS by selecting
appropriate response from the drop-down options. The stage for each individual subcomponent is defined in detail in the Overview
tab, under the Stages of Progression. The User Guide details the process of completing the assessment.

In order to complete this assessment, you will need to login to the web-based application built using DHIS 2 to access the
assessment and related analytics. Please note responses from all the participants of the assessments will be aggregated and used
to guide the stakeholder consultation process. The stakeholder consultation will discuss and interpret scores for each of the
components and sub-components and then determine the final score. The final score will be used to develop the HIS improvement
roadmap.
