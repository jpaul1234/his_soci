You will use the digital version of the HIS SOCI tool to assess your national HIS as an exercise to  test the digital version of the tool.</p><p><h2>What is HIS SOCI?</h2></p><p>The HIS SOCI assessment tool measures the status and goals of an HIS across five stages, identifies gaps, and supports the development of roadmaps to improve HIS capabilities related to processes, people, and systems essential for achieving a countryâ€™s health goals. This toolkit responds to these research questions:</p><ol><li>What are the stages of HIS development? </li><li>How can HIS be assessed and their maturity   continuously improved to achieve better health outcomes? </li></ol><p>The assessment is based on a measurement scale consisting of 39 essential HIS subcomponents across five stages from emerging to optimized. The scale outlines key components of HIS improvement and defines attributes of each subcomponent on a five-point Likert scale. For more information about the full toolkit and its creation, visit: <a href='https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit'>https://www.measureevaluation.org/his-strengthening-resource-center/his-stages-of-continuous-improvement-toolkit</a></p><p><h2>How do I complete the assessment?</h2></p><p>For each of the 39 subcomponents, you will be asked to determine the current and goal status of your national HIS by selecting appropriate response from the drop-down options. <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'>The stage for each individual subcomponent is defined in detail in the Documentation tab.</span> The attached document will guide you through the process of completing the assessment. This is a test assessment.Your responses will be used only to refine the tool; your answers will not be shared or used for any other purpose.</p><p>If you agree to complete the assessment, please keep the following in mind:</p><ul style='list-style-type:disc;'><li>Is the assessment interface user friendly? How could it be improved?</li><li>Was the assessment process clear? What could  improve this process?</li><li>How long did it take to complete the assessment?</li><li>Were the assessment analytics clear and easy to understand? How could they be improved?</li></ul><p>In order to complete this assessment, you will need to login to the web-based application built using DHIS 2 to access the assessment and related analytics.You will receive a separate email with login information and a link to complete the assessment <a href=" +api +"/api/apps/HIS-SOCI-tool/index.html#/setup?id=" + respondent.id + "&assessment=" + data.id + ">" + api +"/api/apps/HIS-SOCI-tool/index.html#/setup?id=" + respondent.id+ "&assessment="+ data.id  + "</a></p>.Please note responses from all the participants of the assessments will be aggregated and used to guide the stakeholder consultation process. The stakeholder consultation will discuss and interpret scores for each of the components and sub-components and then determine the final score. The final score will be used to develop the HIS improvement roadmap.</p><p><h3>Thank you for your time and support to improving the HIS SOCI tool. </h3></p><p><h3>If you have any clarifying question, please write to <span style='background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow'><a href='mailto:emillar@email.unc.edu'>emillar@email.unc.edu</a></span></h3></p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Manish Kumar</p><p>Liz Millar</p><p>MEASURE Evaluation </p></div></body></html>",
